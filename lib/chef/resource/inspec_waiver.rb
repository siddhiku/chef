      **Add an InSpec waiver to the Compliance Phase**:

      ```ruby
        inspec_waiver 'Add waiver entry for control' do
          control 'my_inspec_control_01'
          run_test false
          justification "The subject of this control is not managed by #{ChefUtils::Dist::Infra::PRODUCT} on the systems in policy group \#{node['policy_group']}"

      **Add an InSpec waiver to the Compliance Phase using the 'name' property to identify the control**:
